# spam-or-ham
Developed a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or
not spam. Leveraged a dataset containing thousands of email
samples with labeled data. Employed natural language processing
(NLP) techniques, including tokenization, stopword removal, and
TF-IDF vectorization, to preprocess the text data. Implemented
various classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes,Random
Forest to evaluate their performance. Tuned hyperparameters to
optimize model accuracy, achieving an accuracy of 98% on the test set.
